 * # 🌈 Welcome to Raytracer: YOUR CPU GOES BRRRRR! 🌀
 *
 * Raytracer is a command-line rendering engine that generates realistic images by simulating
 * the inverse path of light. ✨✨
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🚀 Quick Start
 *
 * Compile the project with `make` or using `cmake`.
 *
 * Then, run the following command:
 * ```
 * ./raytracer <SCENE_FILE>
 * ```
 * > `SCENE_FILE` is a configuration file describing the scene to be rendered (in `.cfg` format using libconfig++).
 *
 * Help is also available via:
 * ```
 * ./raytracer --help
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🔧 Configuration File (`.cfg`)
 *
 * The scene file defines:
 * - 📷 the camera (`camera`)
 * - 🔶 the primitives (`spheres`, `planes`, etc.)
 * - 💡 the lighting (`lights`)
 *
 * Example:
 * ```cfg
 * camera: {
 *   resolution = { width = 1920; height = 1080; };
 *   position = { x = 0; y = -100; z = 20; };
 *   rotation = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *   fieldOfView = 72.0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🎮 Camera Control
 *
 * Camera movements and rotations are set in the `.cfg` file with:
 * - `position = { x, y, z };`
 * - `rotation = { x, y, z };`
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 📦 Main Features
 *
 * ✅ Supported Primitives:
 * - Sphere
 * - Plane
 *
 * ✅ Transformations:
 * - Translation
 *
 * ✅ Lighting:
 * - Directional light
 * - Ambient light
 *
 * ✅ Materials:
 * - Flat color
 *
 * ✅ Interface:
 * - Output image in `.ppm` (no GUI)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 📁 Organization
 *
 * - The `raytracer` binary is at the root of the project.
 * - Dynamic plugins (bonus) are located in the `./plugins/` folder.
 * - Scenes are stored in `./scenes/`, and renders in `./screenshots/`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## ⚙️ Compilation
 *
 * ### Makefile
 * - Required targets: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`
 *
 * ### CMake (optional):
 * ```bash
 * mkdir build && cd build
 * cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 * cmake --build .
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🔌 Extensions and Plugins (bonus)
 *
 * The raytracer can dynamically load plugins from `./plugins/`.
 * These plugins can add:
 * - Additional primitives
 * - New types of lights
 * - Optical effects, etc.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 📐 Design Patterns Used
 *
 * You must implement at least **2 design patterns** among:
 * - Factory, Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, State, Mediator
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🧪 Demonstration & Defense
 *
 * Prepare several `.cfg` scenes and their rendered `.ppm` outputs to showcase your project!
 *
 * ---
 *
 * 💖 Enjoy your Raytracer engine! The more features you add, the closer you get to *true photorealism*! 🌟

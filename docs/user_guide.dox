 * # 🌈 Welcome to Raytracer: YOUR CPU GOES BRRRRR! 🌀
 *
 * Raytracer is a command-line rendering engine that generates realistic images by simulating
 * the inverse path of light. ✨✨
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🚀 Quick Start
 *
 * Compile the project with `make` or using `cmake`.
 *
 * Then, run the following command:
 * ```
 * ./raytracer <SCENE_FILE>
 * ```
 * > `SCENE_FILE` is a configuration file describing the scene to be rendered (in `.cfg` format using libconfig++).
 *
 * Help is also available via:
 * ```
 * ./raytracer --help
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🔧 Configuration File (`.cfg`)
 *
 * The scene file defines:
 * - 📷 the camera (`camera`)
 * - 🔶 the primitives (`spheres`, `planes`, etc.)
 * - 💡 the lighting (`lights`)
 *
 * Example:
 * ```cfg
 * camera: {
 *   resolution = { width = 1920; height = 1080; };
 *   position = { x = 0; y = -100; z = 20; };
 *   rotation = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *   fieldOfView = 72.0;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### 📂 Scene Configuration Structure
 * 
 * Scene files use the libconfig++ format and are organized into three main sections:
 * 
 * #### 1. Camera Configuration
 * ```cfg
 * camera: {
 *   resolution = { width = 1920; height = 1080; };
 *   position = { x = 0; y = -100; z = 20; };
 *   rotation = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *   fieldOfView = 72.0;
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * #### 2. Primitives Configuration
 * Primitives are organized by type in array format:
 * ```cfg
 * primitives: {
 *   # Spheres with position, radius and color
 *   spheres = (
 *     { x = 60; y = 5; z = 40; r = 25; color = { r = 255; g = 64; b = 64; }; },
 *     { x = -40; y = 20; z = -10; r = 35; color = { r = 64; g = 255; b = 64; }; }
 *   );
 *   
 *   # Planes with axis, position and color
 *   planes = (
 *     { axis = "Z"; position = -20; color = { r = 64; g = 64; b = 255; }; }
 *   );
 *   
 *   # Cylinders with radius and color
 *   cylinders = (
 *     { 
 *       radius = 5;
 *       color = { r = 0; g = 255; b = 255; };
 *       transform = {
 *         translate = { x = 10; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *         rotate = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 90; };
 *       };
 *     }
 *   );
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * #### 3. Lighting Configuration
 * ```cfg
 * lights: {
 *   ambient = 0.3;
 *   diffuse = 0.7;
 *   
 *   # Point lights with position and color
 *   point = (
 *     { x = 200; y = 50; z = 0; color = { r = 255; g = 255; b = 255; }; }
 *   );
 *   
 *   # Directional lights with direction and color
 *   directional = (
 *     { direction = { x = -1; y = -1; z = -1; }; color = { r = 255; g = 255; b = 255; }; }
 *   );
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * ### 📝 Example Scenes
 * 
 * The project includes several example scenes in the `scenes/` directory that you can use as templates:
 * 
 * - `scenes/basic_scene.cfg` - A simple scene with a few spheres and a plane
 * - `scenes/complex_scene.cfg` - A more complex scene with multiple primitive types
 * - `scenes/demo_sphere.cfg` - Showcase of spheres with various transformations
 * - `scenes/demo_cylinder.cfg` - Demonstration of cylinder primitives
 * 
 * To run an example scene:
 * ```bash
 * ./raytracer scenes/basic_scene.cfg
 * ```
 * 
 * ### 🛠️ Configuration Tips
 * 
 * - All primitive attributes support both integer and float values
 * - Colors are defined with RGB values from 0-255
 * - Comments can be added with `#` or `//`
 * - Transformation blocks can be added to any primitive for positioning
 * - The order of sections (camera, primitives, lights) is not important
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🎮 Camera Control
 *
 * Camera movements and rotations are set in the `.cfg` file with:
 * - `position = { x, y, z };`
 * - `rotation = { x, y, z };`

 * - Dynamic plugins (bonus) are located in the `./plugins/` folder.
 * - Scenes are stored in `./scenes/`, and renders in `./screenshots/`.
 *

 *
 * ## ⚙️ Compilation
 *
 * ### Makefile
 * The project provides a comprehensive Makefile with several useful targets:
 * 
 * ```bash
 * make          # Compiles the project and creates the raytracer executable
 * make clean    # Removes object files
 * make fclean   # Removes all compiled files, build directory, and documentation
 * make re       # Completely rebuilds the project (fclean + all)
 * make normalize # Applies clang-format to all C++ files
 * make check_normalize # Checks if code follows clang-format style without modifying
 * make tests_run # Compiles and runs unit tests
 * make cov      # Generates code coverage report (requires lcov)
 * make doc      # Generates documentation using Doxygen and opens it
 * ```
 *
 * ### CMake (optional):
 * If you prefer using CMake directly:
 * ```bash
 * mkdir build && cd build
 * cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 * cmake --build .
 * ```
 * 
 * #### CMake Build Options:
 * - `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` - Enable building test suite
 * - `-DBUILD_PLUGINS=ON` - Enable building plugin modules
 * - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release` - Set build configuration
 *

 *
 * ## 🧠 Extending the Raytracer
 * 
 * ### 🔶 Adding a New Primitive
 * 
 * To add a new primitive to the raytracer, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. **Create the Primitive Class**:
 *    - Implement a class that inherits from `IPrimitive` (or an appropriate interface like `ICylinder` if it's a variant)
 *    - Required methods to implement:
 *      - `intersect()` - Calculate ray intersection with your primitive
 *      - `getNormalAt()` - Calculate surface normal at a point
 *      - `setTransform()`, `getTransform()` - Handle transformations
 *      - `setColor()`, `getColor()` - Handle color properties
 *      - `clone()` - Create a copy of the primitive
 * 
 * 2. **Update the Factory**:
 *    - In `PrimitiveFactory.cpp`, add a creation method for your primitive:
 *      ```cpp
 *      std::shared_ptr<YourPrimitive> PrimitiveFactory::createYourPrimitive(
 *          const Setting& setting) {
 *          // Parse configuration and create your primitive
 *      }
 *      ```
 *    - Add the appropriate entry to the `primitiveCreators` map in the same file
 * 
 * 3. **Add the declaration in PrimitiveFactory.hpp**:
 *    - Declare your creation method
 *    - Include your primitive's header file
 * 
 * 4. **Example Usage in Configuration**:
 *    ```cfg
 *    primitives:
 *    {
 *      yourprimitives = (
 *        {
 *          // Your primitive's parameters
 *          param1 = value1;
 *          color = { r = 255; g = 0; b = 0; };
 *          transform = {
 *            translate = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *            rotate = { x = 0; y = 0; z = 0; };
 *            scale = { x = 1; y = 1; z = 1; };
 *          };
 *        }
 *      );
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 
 * Note that the factory supports multiple formats for primitive parameters:
 * - Direct coordinates: `x = 0; y = 10; z = 5;`
 * - Grouped coordinates: `position = { x = 0; y = 10; z = 5; };`
 * - Both integer and float values
 * 
 * The system also automatically applies transformations if a `transform` block is present.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🔌 Extensions and Plugins (bonus)
 *
 * The raytracer can dynamically load plugins from `./plugins/`.
 * These plugins can add:
 * - Additional primitives
 * - New types of lights
 * - Optical effects, etc.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 📐 Design Patterns Used
 *
 * You must implement at least **2 design patterns** among:
 * - Factory, Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, State, Mediator
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## 🧪 Demonstration & Defense
 *
 * Prepare several `.cfg` scenes and their rendered `.ppm` outputs to showcase your project!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. "I'm always frustrated when..." or "It's currently impossible to render..."

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
Ex: "Add the ability to render spheres" or "Implement shadow casting".

**Describe alternatives you've considered (Optional)**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Technical Approach Suggestion (Optional)**
How do you think this could be implemented? Any ideas about algorithms or data structures?
Ex: "Use the mathematical ray-sphere intersection equation. Modify the main rendering loop to test intersections against a list of objects."

**Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done**
How will we know this feature is complete and working correctly?
Ex:
- [ ] A `intersect_sphere(ray, sphere)` function is created and unit tested.
- [ ] The rendering loop calls this function for each sphere in the scene.
- [ ] A test scene with a sphere renders correctly.
- [ ] Code adheres to the coding standard.
- [ ] Relevant tests have been added.

**Additional context (Optional)**
